// Re-implement the sentiment analysis with regex-based positive and negative word lists. 
// The use of regex to process text-based data is extremely powerful. 
// In the previous practice problem, we did not count words that were just different 
// forms of the words in the positive and negative word lists. 
// For instance, we didn't count "scorns" since it isn't an exact match for "scorn".
