# Exercise 10

# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.


# Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.

# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.

# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, 
# meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.

# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.

# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.

# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
