# Exercise 06

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

# Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?

# `manufacturer` is a class method because we define it with a explicit call to `self`, in this case,
# the `Television` class object itself. We call it on the `Television` class object.
