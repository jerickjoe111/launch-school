# Exercise 04

# Let's practice creating an object hierarchy.

# Create a class called Greeting with a single instance method 
# called greet that takes a string argument and prints that argument to the terminal.

# Now create two other classes that are derived from Greeting: 
# one called Hello and one called Goodbye. 
# The Hello class should have a hi method that takes 
# no arguments and prints "Hello". The Goodbye class 
# should have a bye method to say "Goodbye". Make use of 
# the Greeting class greet method when implementing the Hello and 
# Goodbye classes - do not use any puts in the Hello or Goodbye classes.

class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end
