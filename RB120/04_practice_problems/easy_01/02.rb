# Exercise 02

# If we have a Car class and a Truck class and we want to be able to go_fast, 
# how can we add the ability for them to go_fast using the module Speed? 
# How can you check if your Car or Truck can now go fast?

module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end

# We can include the module `Speed` inside both class definition or we can make a common parent superclass
# `Vehicle` that includes the module.
