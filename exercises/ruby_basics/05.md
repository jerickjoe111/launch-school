***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

***Answer:***

In this problem we deal with an issue similar to the first
problems we analized: it also concerns the difference
between mutating vs. (re)assigning methods.

In line 6 we initialize variable `a` to the string object 
'Xyzzy'; lines 8-10 contain the `my_value` method
declaration, whose body is composed by the initialzation
of variable `b` by its assignation to the string object
`'yzzyX'`. 

In line 12 my call `my_value` passing variable `a` as its
argument, and in the next line we call `puts` and passing also
`a` as argument to it, to print a string representation on the 
screen (plus a new line character at the end). The output we get 
is "Xyzzy". Surprising? Not really. We pass `a` to `my_value`
as an argument, assign it to the method parameter `b` and thus 
making it available to the method body as a local variable; this
means that we are making `b` to point to the same object which `a`
is pointing: "Xyzzy", as if we did `b = a`. If we would use a 
mutating method like `[]=` on `b`, we would actually modify the 
object itself both `a` and `b` are pointing to; but this is not
a mutating operation, but an assignment: `b` is now pointing
to a completely different string object. But `a` still
contains the reference to "Xyzzy".
