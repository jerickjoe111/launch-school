***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b = a + a
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

***Answers:***

This piece of code concerns the variable scope and the fact that method
definitions are self contained respecting outer variables: the method
body can't access outside variables, and inner variables can't be
accessed from the outside.

In the line 9, inside the `my_value` definition, we assign the 
local variable `b`, the method's parameter we use to pass an object
as argument to the method in order to make it availabe inside its
definition, to the result of adding the value of 7 to itself (by calling
`+` method on `a` and using also `a` as its argument). But since
local variable `a` has not been initialized yet, and outer `a` is not
accessible from the inside, the program raises an error, because it
cannot find a variable `a`.
