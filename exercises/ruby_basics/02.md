***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

***Answer:***

The case is exactly the same as the one before, the only difference is that
in this case we name the method's parameter in its declaration `a` instead
of `b`. However, naming a parameter the same way as other variable in an
outer scope, `a = 7`, line 6, is confusing: Ruby does not care about how
we name our variables if them do not share scope. This is a problem for
the reader, though. Method definitions are self_contained with respect
to local variables. Outer local variables like `a` are not *visible* from
the inside of the method, and viceversa.

In line 9 we reassign the local variable `a` (local to the method's body)
to the result of the addition of 10 to the integer which a was pointing to
before, 7. But let's not be confused by the same name: outer `a` and method
local variable `a` do not share scope, and although `my_value` will still
retun 17, and inside the method body pointing to integer 17, when we print
outer `a` in line 13 by calling `puts`, we will see a 7 on the screen and 
not a 17: outer `a` still points to 7; line 9 is a reassigning operation too, 
the same as the previous exercise.
