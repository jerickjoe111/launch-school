***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
```
---
***Answer:***

Again, the problem is exactly the same: we will see still a 7
in our screens, as the outer `a` is not visible from within the
`my_value` method body (methods are self-contained with respect
to local variables)

It is worth noting that we are passing `a + 5` ( the integer 13) 
as an argument to the method: this is perfectly acceptable. However, 
we are not doing anything with it, this method being mostly useless 
as it is.
