***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

***Answers:***

This program will raise an exception, because in line 12 `puts`
is not able to find variable `a`: although `a` is initialized
inside the `each` code block (is not a reassignment), if the 
variable has not been already initialized, that same variable 
won't be available afterwards, because there is no local 
variable `a` defined in this scope.
