***What will the following code print, and why?***

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a
```

***Answers:***

This problem is an example of *shadowing*: because the block's
parameter `a` is named like a variable in the outer scope, that
outer `a` will never be accesible from within the block, and the
reassigning `+=` operation will never have effect on it. `a` is
still 7 when we output it the `puts` invocation in line 13.
