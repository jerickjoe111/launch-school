a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

***Answer:***

NOTE: EXPLAIN PASS BY REFERENCE-VALUE HERE

This case is different, because here we are dealing with 
a mutating method `[]=`.

In line 6 we initialize the variable `a` assigning it 
to the string object `"Xyzzy"`; the `my_value` method
definition here is more interesting: we use the method
`[]=` to mutate the string object that `a` references by setting
the character at the index position 2 (passing 2 as
`[]=` argument), meaning the 3rd character (strings
are 0 indexed) `z`. 

It is critical too to note here that we are not passing the
object itself as argument to the method via its parameter `b`,
but a variable that is pointing to (or referencing) that object;
thus, when we perform the mutating operation (or "setter") by the
`[]=` method over variable `b`, what we are really doing is 'going'
to the place in memory to which `b` is pointing, and resetting
the third character of the object stored there, in this case 
the string `"Xyzzy"`. In consequence, when we, after calling
`my_value` with `a` as its argument, print `a`, we get 
the object that was indeed mutated: `"Xy-zy"`.

This case is also a reminder that string objects are
mutable in Ruby.
