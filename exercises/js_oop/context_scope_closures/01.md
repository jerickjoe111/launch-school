# Exercise 01

Read the following code carefully. What do you think is logged on line 7. Try to answer the question before you run the code.

```js
const person = {
  firstName: 'Rick ',
  lastName: 'Sanchez',
  fullName: this.firstName + this.lastName,
};

console.log(person.fullName);
```

It logs `NaN`: by the time we assign a value for the `fullName` property in the object literal `person`, the value of `this` is not the literal object, but the global object, `window` in the browser, the global object within node (or `undefined` in strict mode.).
