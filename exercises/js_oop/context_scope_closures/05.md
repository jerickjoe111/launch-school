# Exercise 05

Our earlier implementation of the `Function.prototype.bind` was simplistic. `Function.prototype.bind` has another trick up its sleeve besides hard-binding functions to context objects. It's called partial function application. Read this assignment and the MDN documentation to learn more about partial function application.

Alter the `myBind` function written in the previous exercise to support partial function application of additional arguments to the original function.

```js
function myBind(function, context, ...extraArguments) {
  return function(...moreArguments) {
    return function.apply(context, [...extraArguments, ...moreArguments]);
  }
}
```
