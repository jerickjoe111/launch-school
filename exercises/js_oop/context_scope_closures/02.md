# Exercise 02

The method franchise.allMovies is supposed to return the following array:

```
[
  'How to Train Your Dragon 1',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 2',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 3'
]
```
Explain why this method will not return the desired object? Try fixing this problem by taking advantage of JavaScript lexical scoping rules.

```js
const franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies() {
    return [1, 2, 3].map(function(number) {
      return `${this.name} ${number}`;
    });
  },
};
```

Nested functions within methods, called as functions (like the one passed in to `map` within `allMovies`),
lose their context, and `this` no longer refers to the parent object.

```js
const franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies() {
    return [1, 2, 3].map(number => {
      return `${this.name} ${number}`;
    });
  },
};
```
