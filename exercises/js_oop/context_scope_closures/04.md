# Exercise 04

`Function.prototype.bind` is a method on all function objects that allows us to hard-bind a function to a particular object. The way this works is that you pass a context object to the `bind` method, and it returns a new function that is essentially the same function but hard-bound to the context object supplied.

Create a function `myBind`, that accepts two arguments: 
1. The function to bind, 
2. The context object,

and returns a new function that's hard-bound to the passed in context object.

```js
function myBind(function, context) {
  return function() {
    return function.apply(context);
  }
}
```
