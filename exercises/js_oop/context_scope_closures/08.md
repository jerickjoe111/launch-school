# Exercise 08

A stack is a compound data type like an array. The difference between an array and a stack is that in an array you can insert and remove elements in any order you want, but a stack has a rule whereby you can only add new elements at the end and remove the last inserted element.

Create a function `newStack`, that, when called, returns a stack object with three methods: `push`, `pop`, and `printStack`. `push` takes a value and appends it to the stack. `pop` removes and returns the last element from the stack. `printStack` logs each remaining element of the stack on its own line, starting with the item that was least recently added to the stack and ending with the most recently added item that is still on the stack.

Internally, use an array to implement the stack. Make sure that the array is not accessible from outside the methods.

```js
function newStack() {
  let stack = [];
  return {
    push(element) {
      stack.push(element);
    },
    pop() {
      stack.pop();
    },
    printStack() {
      for (let i = stack.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
        console.log(stack[i]);
      };
    }
  }
}
```
