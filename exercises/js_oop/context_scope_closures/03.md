# Exercise 03

In the previous exercise, we had a situation where an anonymous method passed to map had an undesirable execution context. We solved the problem by taking advantage of lexical scoping and introducing a new variable `self`. Solve the same problem again by passing a hard-bound anonymous function to map.

```js
const franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies() {
    return [1, 2, 3].map(function(number) {
      return `${this.name} ${number}`;
    }.bind(this));
  },
};
```
