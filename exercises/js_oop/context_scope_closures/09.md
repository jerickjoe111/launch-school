# Exercise 09

Consider the following code:

```js
const name = 'Naveed';
const greeting = 'Hello';

const greeter = {
  message: `${greeting} ${name}!`,
  sayGreetings() {
    console.log(this.message);
  }
};
```

Note that the `message` property uses the result of interpolation as its value. As a result, we have two global variables: `name`, and `greeting` that pollute the global scope. As we already know, we should limit the use of global variables as much as we can. Here we can avoid using the global variables by simply setting the message property to the value `"Hello Naveed!"`. But let's pretend that we must use variables and interpolation to accomplish this. Can you think of a way to refactor this code so we don't have any other variables in the global scope besides greeter?

```js
function Greeter(greeting, name) {
  this.greeting = greeting;
  this.name = name;
  this.sayGreetings = function() {
    return `${greeting} ${name}!`;
  };
}

let greeter = new Greeter('Hello', 'Naveed');
```
