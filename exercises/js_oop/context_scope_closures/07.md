# Exercise 07

Read the following code carefully. Will the JavaScript garbage collection mechanism garbage collect the array assigned to the variable `array` after the function `pushIt` is called on line 11?

```js
function makeArrays() {
  let array = [];

  return () => {
    array.push('');
    return array;
  };
}

const pushIt = makeArrays();
pushIt();
// more code
```

No, as the function returned from `makeArrays()` and assigned to `pushIt` still retains a reference to `array` in its closure.
