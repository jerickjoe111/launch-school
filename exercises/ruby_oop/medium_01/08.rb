# Exercise 08

# Exercise 06

# Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking 
# and highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:

# For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. 
# Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher 
# than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the 
# relative ranking of cards.

# If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and 
# max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

# Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create 
# a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the card, 
# e.g., "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.
