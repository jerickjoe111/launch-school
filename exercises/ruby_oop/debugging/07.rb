# Exercise 07

# We created a simple BankAccount class with overdraft protection, 
# that does not allow a withdrawal greater than the amount of the current balance. 
# We wrote some example code to test our program. However, we are surprised by 
# what we see when we test its behavior. Why are we seeing this unexpected output? 
# Make changes to the code so that we see the appropriate behavior.

class BankAccount
  attr_accessor :balance

  def initialize(account_number, client)
    @account_number = account_number
    @client = client
    @balance = 0
  end

  def deposit(amount)
    if amount > 0
      self.balance += amount
      "$#{amount} deposited. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter a positive amount."
    end
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    if amount > 0 && valid_transaction?(balance - amount)
      self.balance -= amount
      "$#{amount} withdrawn. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($#{balance})."
    end
  end

  def valid_transaction?(new_balance)
    new_balance >= 0
  end
end

# Example

account = BankAccount.new('5538898', 'Genevieve')

                          # Expected output:
p account.balance         # => 0
p account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
p account.withdraw(80)    # => Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($50).
                          # Actual output: $80 withdrawn. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
