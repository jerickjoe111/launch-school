// Exercise 07

// We're putting together some information about our new company Space Design. 
// Not all roles have been filled yet. 
// But although we have a CEO and Scrum Master, 
// displaying them shows undefined. Why is that?

// Roles (salary still to be determined)

const ceo = {
  tasks: ['company strategy', 'resource allocation', 'performance monitoring'],
  salary: 0,
};

const developer = {
  tasks: ['turn product vision into code'],
  salary: 0,
};

const scrumMaster = {
  tasks: ['organize scrum process', 'manage scrum teams'],
  salary: 0,
};

// Team -- we're hiring!

const team = {};

team['ceo'] = 'Kim'; // change property names to proper strings
team['scrumMaster'] = 'Alice';
team['developer'] = undefined;

const company = {
  name: 'Space Design',
  team,
  projectedRevenue: 500000,
