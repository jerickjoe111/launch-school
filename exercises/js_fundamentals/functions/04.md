 Exercise 04

```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  console.log(myVar);
}

someFunction();
```

We will see `'This is global'` on the terminal. This is the case because `myVar`, being a global variable declared in the outermost scope, is accessible from within the body of the function. Within the function, JavaScript first looks up in the current local scope, and, if there's no variable with the name it's looking for, then it looks up in the surrounding, outer scopes until the variable is found.
