 Exercise 06

```js
let a = 7;

function myValue(b) {
  b += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

When we pass the variable `a` as an argument to `myValue()`, it is evaluated and its value, the primitive `7`, it's assigned to the parameter `b` within the function. So, when this argument gets reassigned to the new sum value after the `+=` operator, the operation has no effect on the outer variable `a`, which is still assigned to `7`. This also demonstrates that the primitive values are immutable.
