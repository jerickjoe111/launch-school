 Exercise 03

```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

In this case, we will see `'This is local'` printed on the screen. This happens because, after declaring a global variable `myVar` in the outer scope, the function has access to it within its body, where we are reassigning this variable to a new string `'This is local'`.
