 Exercise 09

```js
console.log(a);

var a = 1;
```

This prints the value `undefined`. This is the case because, although variable _declarations_ are hoisted in JavaScript, the actual initialization assignment remains in the same place. We are able to reference the variable without an error because variable declared with `var` are set to a value of `undefined` until initialized, contrary to `let` and `const` variables.
