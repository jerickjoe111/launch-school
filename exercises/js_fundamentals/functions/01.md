 Exercise 01

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

This code will print `'This is local'`. This is the case because the variable declared within the body of the function is confined to the function, as variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, while the `myVar` from the outer scope, being a different variable in a different scope, remains assigned to the original string.

LS:

> JavaScript uses lexical scope. This means that it determines the scope of a variable by the structure of the program. This program declares a variable named myVar in two places. The first is outside of any function, giving the first myVar a global scope. The second place is inside of someFunction. Functions in JavaScript create a new scope â€” a scope that is "local" to the function. This local scope is also referred to as an "inner" scope in relation to the global "outer" scope. On line 8, console.log(myVar) logs "This is global" because the two myVar variables, on lines 1 and 4, belong to different scopes. someFunction has its own local "inner" scope, so the myVar declaration within the function has no effect on the global "outer" scope.
