 Exercise 07

```js
let a = 7;

function myValue(a) {
  a += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

This is exactly the same case as before, it just happens the parameter of `myValue()` to have the same name as the global variable `a`. This is a case of variable shadowing; the reassignment within the body of the function has no effect in the outer variable `a`.
