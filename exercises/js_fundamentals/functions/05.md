 Exercise 05

```js
function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is global';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

In this case, JavaScript looks in the outer scope looking for a `myVar` declaration, but, if there's not, it creates the variable as a property of the global object, which makes it globally available (but not exactly a global variable)
