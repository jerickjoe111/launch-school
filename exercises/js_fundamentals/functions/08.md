 Exercise 08

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];

function myValue(b) {
  b[2] += 7;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

This will log `[1, 2, 10]`. This is the case because, when we pass `a` as an argument to the function `myValue()`, we are actually passing a reference to the object which `a` is pointing to, in this case, an array. In consequence, the parameter `b` is assigned to this same array. So we are able to mutate it permanently by reassigning an element in the array. This demonstrates that the objects are mutable in JavaScript.
