// Exercise 09

// We can use the number of minutes before or after midnight to represent the time of day. 
// If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. 
// If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

// The timeOfDay function shown below takes a time argument 
// using this minute-based format, and returns the time of day in 24-hour 
// format ("hh:mm"). Reimplement the function using JavaScript's Date object.
