# >>>>>> Problem

# Write a method that takes two sorted Arrays as arguments, 
# and returns a new Array that contains all elements from 
# both arguments in sorted order.

# input: two arrays

# output: a new sorted array containing all elements of both input arrays


# >>>>>> Caveats

# You may not provide any solution that requires you to sort the result array. 
# You must build the result array one element at a time in the proper order.

# Your solution should not mutate the input arrays.

# >>>>>> Examples and test cases

# merge([1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 8]) == [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9]
# merge([1, 1, 3], [2, 2]) == [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
# merge([], [1, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
# merge([1, 4, 5], []) == [1, 4, 5]
