# ðŸ“š Welcome to my Launch School Core Curriculum remote repository. ðŸ“š

Here you will find:

1. One folder for each course (i.e.: "RB101/")
2. One folder for each lesson inside each course (i.e.: "RB101/02_small_programs")
3. One main folder for the exercises ("exercises/")
4. One folder for each set inside the "exercises" folder (i.e.: "exercises/easy_01")

| To see special projects that requrired external deployment, like the ones for LS175,  please, visit the repositories prefixed with 'LS-'  |

Feel free to visit also my personal projects repos.

Thank you.
