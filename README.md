# Hi! Welcome to my Launch School core curriculum remote repository.

Here you will find:

1. One folder for each course (i.e.: "RB101/")
2. One folder for each lesson inside each course (i.e.: "RB101/02_small_programs")
3. One main folder for the exercises
4. One folder for each set inside the "exercises" folder (i.e.: "exercises/easy_01")

Feel free also to visit my personal projects repos.

Thank you.
