Hi! Welcome to my Launch School core curriculum remote repository.

This repo will contain:

1. One folder for each course (i.e.: "RB101/")
2. One folder for each lesson inside each course (i.e.: "RB101/02_small_programs")
3. One folder for the exercises
4. One folder for each lesson exercises inside the exercises folder (i.e.: "exercises/RB101_small_problems/")
5. One folder for each set inside the lesson exercises folder (i.e.: "exercises/RB101_small_problems/easy_01")
6. One extra folder for practice, testing, etc.

Feel free also to visit my personal projects repos.

Thank you.
