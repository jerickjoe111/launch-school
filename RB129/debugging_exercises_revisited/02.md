# Exercise 02

The code below raises an exception. Examine the error message and alter the code so that it runs without error.

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize(diet, superpower)
    @diet = diet
    @superpower = superpower
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm moving!"
  end

  def superpower
    puts "I can #{@superpower}!"
  end
end

class Fish < Animal
  def move
    puts "I'm swimming!"
  end
end

class Bird < Animal
end

class FlightlessBird < Bird
  # def initialize(diet, superpower)
  #   super
  # end

  def move
    puts "I'm running!"
  end
end

class SongBird < Bird
  def initialize(diet, superpower, song)
    # Before: super
    super(diet, superpower) # We have to explicitly declare what specific arguments we want to forward.
    @song = song
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm flying!"
  end
end

# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')
```

The problem lays in the `super` keyword on line 42. By default, if we only provide the `super` keyword, it will automatically forward every argument that was passed to the method that contains it to the next method up in the inheritance chain, in this case, the `initialize` instance method defined in the `Animal` class. However, this constructor method only accepts two arguments, while we are forwarding three from the `initialize` on lines 41-45 (`diet`, `superpower`, and `song`). 

To fix this, we have to be explicit about the arguments we want to forward to the next `initialize`: if we add a specific list of arguments, only these will be forwarded.

On the other hand, the `initialize` on lines 31-33 is not really necessary, as it does what the `initialize` in the super-superclass `Animal` already does.
