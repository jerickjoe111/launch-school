# Exercise 07

We created a simple BankAccount class with overdraft protection, that does not allow a withdrawal greater than the amount of the current balance. We wrote some example code to test our program. However, we are surprised by what we see when we test its behavior. Why are we seeing this unexpected output? Make changes to the code so that we see the appropriate behavior.

```ruby
require 'pry'

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(account_number, client)
    @account_number = account_number
    @client = client
    @balance = 0
  end

  def deposit(amount)
    if amount > 0
      self.balance += amount
      "$#{amount} deposited. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter a positive amount."
    end
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    # Before:
    # success = if amount > 0 then (self.balance -= amount)
    #           else false
    #           end

    # Added:
    success = if amount > 0 && amount <= balance then (self.balance -= amount)
              else false
              end

    if success
      "$#{amount} withdrawn. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($#{balance})."
    end
  end

  def balance=(new_balance)
    if valid_transaction?(new_balance)
      @balance = new_balance
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end

  def valid_transaction?(new_balance)
    new_balance >= 0
  end
end

# Example

account = BankAccount.new('5538898', 'Genevieve')

                          # Expected output:
p account.balance         # => 0
p account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
p account.withdraw(80)    # => Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($50).
                          # Actual output: $80 withdrawn. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
```
The problem is that we were allowed to withdraw more money that we had, because there was no condition that checked if we had enough money to withdraw. We have fixed that by adding an extra condition for the assignment of the local variable `success`, `amount <= balance` that confirmed exactly that. Once we make sure the amount to withdraw is positive (more than zero), and the amount is less or equal to the money we have, `success` is assigned to an integer, wich, having a value of `truth` in Ruby, will work to confirm via a message returned from the `withdraw` method that the operation has been successful. If we introduced an invalid amount, `success` would be assigned to `false`, which will bring us to the unsuccessful operation message.
