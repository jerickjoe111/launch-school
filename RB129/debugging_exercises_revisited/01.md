# Exercise 01

On line 42 of our code, we intend to display information regarding the books currently checked in to our community library. Instead, an exception is raised. Determine what caused this error and fix the code so that the data is displayed as expected.

```ruby
class Library
  attr_accessor :address, :phone, :books

  def initialize(address, phone)
    @address = address
    @phone = phone
    @books = []
  end

  def check_in(book)
    books.push(book)
  end

  # Added
  def display_books
    books.each(&:display_data)
  end
end

class Book
  attr_accessor :title, :author, :isbn

  def initialize(title, author, isbn)
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @isbn = isbn
  end

  def display_data
    puts "---------------"
    puts "Title: #{title}"
    puts "Author: #{author}"
    puts "ISBN: #{isbn}"
    puts "---------------"
  end
end

community_library = Library.new('123 Main St.', '555-232-5652')
learn_to_program = Book.new('Learn to Program', 'Chris Pine', '978-1934356364')
little_women = Book.new('Little Women', 'Louisa May Alcott', '978-1420951080')
wrinkle_in_time = Book.new('A Wrinkle in Time', 'Madeleine L\'Engle', '978-0312367541')

community_library.check_in(learn_to_program)
community_library.check_in(little_women)
community_library.check_in(wrinkle_in_time)

# Before: community_library.books.display_data
community_library.display_books
```

The exception was raised because we were trying to call the instance method `display_data` on the array returned from the getter defined in the `Library` class, `books`, containing `Book` instances. This array can't find any method `display_data` in its method lookup path, so an exception is raised (`undefined method`). 

Instead, we have to call `display_data` on each one of the `Book` instances that the `books` array is containing: to do that, we define a new instance method `display_book` in the `Library` class that will iterate
for every book in the `books` array and call `display_data` on each one. If we call our new `display_books` methods on the `community_library` instance of `Library` on line 53, we get the desired output.
