# Exercise 03

On lines 37 and 38 of our code, we can see that grace and ada are located at the same coordinates. So why does line 39 output false? Fix the code to produce the expected output.

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name
  attr_accessor :location

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def teleport_to(latitude, longitude)
    @location = GeoLocation.new(latitude, longitude)
  end
end

class GeoLocation
  attr_reader :latitude, :longitude

  def initialize(latitude, longitude)
    @latitude = latitude
    @longitude = longitude
  end

  def to_s
    "(#{latitude}, #{longitude})"
  end

  # Added:
  def ==(other_location)
    to_s == other_location.to_s
  end
end

# Example

ada = Person.new('Ada')
ada.location = GeoLocation.new(53.477, -2.236)

grace = Person.new('Grace')
grace.location = GeoLocation.new(-33.89, 151.277)

ada.teleport_to(-33.89, 151.277)

puts ada.location                   # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts grace.location                 # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts ada.location == grace.location # expected: true
                                    # actual: false
```

Here the problem lays in that we were making use of the default `==` method, defined in the `BasicObject` class, super parent class of all objects in Ruby. By default, this method checks if two objects are indeed the same object, so many built in classes redefine it, overriding it with other functionality (i.e: the comparison of the content of an string object). In this case, we were getting `false` returned because `ada` and `grace` are not the same object. In order to compare their locations, we had to redefine a `==` method in the `GeoLocation` class that compares the string object returned from the corresponding `to_s` instance methods. Notice we are building our own custom `==` on top of the `==` defined in the `String` class, as we are indeed comparing two string objects.
