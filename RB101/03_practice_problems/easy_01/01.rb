# Question 1

  # uniq returns a new version of the receiver array in which duplicates are removed, 
  # but, in this case, as the method does not modify the receiver (unlike its uniq! counterpart),
  # when we print the array, it still has the duplicate numbers.

  # Notice that the puts method prints each element of the array in a different line, instead of
  # printing the literal array notation with its content, as it would have happend if we had 
  # called the p method (that automatically calls the inspect method and prints the result)
