  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from
    a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't
    you join me?
  </p>

  <p class="more-text">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with <strong>HTML</strong> &amp;
    <strong>CSS</strong>. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color
    than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of <strong>CSS</strong>
    will help accomplish that.
  </p>

  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as
    an `id` attribute. We'll use some <strong>CSS</strong> and the `id` attribute to underline
    the entire paragraph.
  </p>
