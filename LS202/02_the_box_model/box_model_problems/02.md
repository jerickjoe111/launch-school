2. Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the `div` needs to entirely contain the `section` element (including its margins)? How does this differ from the result of the previous practice problem?

```html
<div>
  <section>content</section>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

section {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

Horizontally: *580px*

- 500px for the content (width)
- 40px for the horizontal padding
- 8px for the borders
- 30px for the margins
- 2px for the `div` borders

Vertically: *360px*

- 300px for the content (height)
- 20px for the vertical padding
- 8px for the borders
- 30px for the margins
- 2px for the `div` borders

The values are the same as the previous exercise; the difference here is that in this case the element will occupy the whole row, being its `display: block`.
