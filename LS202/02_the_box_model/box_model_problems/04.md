4. Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the div needs to be to entirely contain the article element (including its margins)?

```html
<div>
  <article>content</article>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

article {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

As the `box-sizing` property has a value of `border-box` in the `article` style rule, we just ignore the border and padding and calculate the actual size based on the width/height plus the margins:

532px of width, 332px of height.
