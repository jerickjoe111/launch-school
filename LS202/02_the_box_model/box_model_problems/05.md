5. Given the code below:

```html
<div>
  <tag1>content</tag1><tag2>content</tag2>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 720px;
}

tag1, tag2 {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 240px;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 360px;
}

tag1 {
  background-color: yellow;
}

tag2 {
  background-color: lime;
}
```

Which of the following element pairs will display side by side in the <div>? Select all that apply:

1. Both elements are `block` elements.
2. Both elements are `inline` elements.
3. Both elements are `inline-block` elements.
4. One element is a `block` element, and one is an `inline` element.
5. One element is a `block` element, and one is an `inline-block` element.
6. One element is an `inline` element, and one is an `inline-block` element.

You may assume that any `inline` element has a content width of no more than 360 pixels. Remember, the `width` property doesn't affect `inline` elements, so this "content width" is the actual width of the content area as determined by your browser.


2, 3 and 6. A `block` element always stands out by itself
